**Remember that onClick handlers should be functions, not calls to functions. 
 X Wrong : onClick = {function ellie()} 
So if you want to call a function in a handler, you may need to make an arrow function. 
  Correct : onClick = {() => function ellie ()}


**The onClick handler is a function which takes an event (ALWAYS)


**if you write onClick={(item) => updatePage(item)} you will pass the event to updatePage
BUT that’s not what you want - you want to pass the item


**So if you write onClick={(item) => updatePage(item)}
You are saying:
“Make a function, and whatever argument is given to it (which will be the event), pass that to updatePage”
Which means you’re passing the event to updatePage


**In this code:
onClick={(event) => updatePage(item)}
You’re not passing the argument to updatePage
There are two different variables there:
event(which is the argument to the onClick handler - the event), 
and item, which is a variable you’re making earlier in the function Added to your saved items.
If you write onClick={(item) => updatePage(item)}
you’re saying “Whatever the argument to the onClick is (the event), give that to updatePage
If you write onClick={(event) => updatePage(item)} 
you’re saying “I don’t care what argument was given to onClick (the event), give the item to updatePage
